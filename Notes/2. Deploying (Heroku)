Welcome to the deployment lesson of Hello Django.
In this lesson, you will prepare your small project for deployment, create an app on a cloud
hosting provider, and deploy your project. The basic steps to deploying a project are
always the same. We recommend that you deploy your projects early and regularly.
It is not a good idea to leave deployment until the final minutes of a deadline.
First, you will go through the text steps to deploy your project.
In these steps, you will prepare your project by adding extra files and changing
some of the contents of the settings.py file. When your project is successfully deployed,
we will take a deeper dive into exactly what happens inside Djangoâ€™s settings.py file.
Then, we will investigate the importance of the requirements.txt file.
Finally, you will be asked to re-deploy your project.
There will then be a quiz to test your knowledge.
As before, please follow the text steps closely and engage with the challenges in
the code breakdown topics. Spending time on the challenges will be worth it because you will get
a much deeper understanding of the topic. Now that you know what to expect in this
lesson, return to your Hello World workspace and get ready to deploy!
